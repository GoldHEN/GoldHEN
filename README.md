### :warning: Warnings

The BinLoader server is in an experimental phase but in any case there are several payloads around, some even not very well done, which can also be harmful and in the best case only crash the console. So use it with caution.
I have tried to work out to support all payloads possible but no guarantees can be given on this. Obviously I do not take any responsibility in case of use of payloads not made by me.

### :warning: Cheat Menu

The Cheat Menu is experimental, use with caution.
Please report cheat related issues to the cheat author(s).

Read [CHEATMENU.md](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN/blob/master/CHEATMENU.md) for more information.

### Note
Project source code is currently private because over time I have seen a sad abuse of the source code that I, like the previous devs who worked on it, have been pleased to make it available to everyone to study and maybe improve it.
